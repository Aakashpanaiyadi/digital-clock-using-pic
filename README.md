Digital Clock Simulation using PIC Microcontroller

  This project is a digital clock designed and tested in Proteus using a PIC microcontroller.

  The clock is displayed on six multiplexed 7-segment displays.

  PORTB is used for segment data, while PORTC controls digit selection.

  Timer0 generates delays for accurate timing.

  The clock counts seconds, minutes, and hours, and updates continuously.

  Entire design and testing were done in Proteus simulation.
